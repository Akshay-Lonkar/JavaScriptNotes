# What’s Prototype?

Almost all objects in JavaScript have the prototype property. By using it and more specifically the _prototype chain_ we can mimic inheritance.

The prototype is a reference to another object and it is used whenever JS can’t find the property you’re looking for on the current object.

Simply put, whenever you call a property on an object and it doesn’t exist, JavaScript will go to the prototype object and look for it there. This can bubble up all the way to Object.prototype before returning undefined. This is the essence of the prototype chain and the behavior that sits behind JavaScript’s inheritance.

# Problem with creating objects with the constructor function:

Consider the constructor function below:

```javascript
function Human(firstName, lastName) {
	(this.firstName = firstName),
		(this.lastName = lastName),
		(this.fullName = function () {
			return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
		});
}

var person1 = new Human('Virat', 'Kohli');
var person2 = new Human('Sachin', 'Tendulkar');
```
