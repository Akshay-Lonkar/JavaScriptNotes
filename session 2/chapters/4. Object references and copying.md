# Object references and copying

[ref](https://javascript.info/object-copy)

One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects are stored and copied “by reference”, whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc – are always copied “as a whole value”.

**But, copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object.**

# Comparison by reference

Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.

For instance, here a and b reference the same object, thus they are equal:

```javascript
let a = {};
let b = a; // copy the reference

alert(a == b); // true, both variables reference the same object
alert(a === b); // true
```

And here two independent objects are not equal, even though they look alike (both are empty):

```javascript
let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert(a == b); // false
```

For comparisons like obj1 > obj2 or for a comparison against a primitive obj == 5, objects are converted to primitives.

# Cloning and merging, Object.assign

If we need to duplicate an object? Create an independent copy, a clone?

we can use following methods for that.

1. spread syntax
2. Object.assign

## 1. spread syntax

```javascript
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

// spread the object into a list of parameters
// then return the result in a new object

let objCopy = { ...obj };
```

## 2. Object.assign

The syntax is:

```javascript
Object.assign(dest, [src1, src2, src3...])
```

here's how we can use it to merge several objects into one

```javascript
let user = { name: 'John' };

let permissions1 = { canView: true };
let permissions2 = { canEdit: true };

// copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user
Object.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);

// now user = { name: "John", canView: true, canEdit: true }
```

If the copied property name already exists, it gets overwritten:

```javascript
let user = { name: 'John' };

Object.assign(user, { name: 'Pete' });

alert(user.name); // now user = { name: "Pete" }
```

following copies all properties of user into the empty object and returns it.

```javascript
let user = {
	name: 'John',
	age: 30,
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);
```

# Nested cloning

Until now we assumed that all properties of user are primitive. But properties can be references to other objects. How they will be copied?

**Answer: They will be copied by reference.**

```javascript
let user = {
	name: 'John',
	sizes: {
		height: 182,
		width: 50,
	},
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert(user === clone); // FALSE, DIFFERENT OBJECT *****NOTE****

alert(user.sizes === clone.sizes); // true, same object

// user and clone share sizes
user.sizes.width++; // change a property from one place
alert(clone.sizes.width); // 51, see the result from the other one
```

**How to resolve?**

To fix that, we should use a cloning loop that examines each value of `user[key]` and, if it’s an `object`, then replicate its structure as well. That is called a “deep cloning”.

We can use recursion to implement it. Or, to not reinvent the wheel, take an existing implementation, for instance `_.cloneDeep(obj)` from the JavaScript library `lodash`.

# Side effect of storing objects as references

An important side effect of storing objects as references is that an object declared as `const` can be modified.

```javascript
const user = {
	name: 'John',
};

user.name = 'Pete'; // (*)

alert(user.name); // Pete
```

The value of `user` is constant, it must always reference the same object, but properties of that object are free to change.

In other words, the const user gives an error only if we try to set `user=...` as a whole.

// TODO [take notes from here - property-descriptors](https://javascript.info/property-descriptors)

That said, if we really need to make constant object properties, it’s also possible, but using totally different methods. We’ll mention that in the chapter Property flags and descriptors.
