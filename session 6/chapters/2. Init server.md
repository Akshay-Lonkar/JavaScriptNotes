# Express

Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

for our project, we will install `express` and other helpful libraries

```
npm i express express-fileupload cors dotenv tsyringe
```

cors is a piece of Express.js middleware that allows us to enable cross-origin resource sharing. Without this, our API would only be usable from front ends being served from the exact same subdomain as our back end.

Our back end uses these packages when it’s running. But we also need to install some development dependencies for our TypeScript configuration. For that, we’ll run:

```
npm i --save-dev @types/cors @types/express @types/express-fileupload
```
